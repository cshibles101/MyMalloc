MyMalloc

C Program written for CS 214: Systems Programming during my fifth semester at Rutgers University. 
Our task was to create our own versions of C functions Malloc and Free. We created a block of memory
and had to be able to Malloc and reserve a portion of the block and then had to be able to Free the 
reserved block for later use. Our MyMalloc and MyFree functions had to abide by the same rules as Malloc
and Free such as only being able to Malloc when space is available and only being able to Free previously
allocated memory.
